3. Date of data collection (single date, range, approximate date): Above-ground seed removal data for the dry season was collected in mid-March through mid-April 2013. Above-ground seed removal data for the wet season was collected in mid-July through mid-August 2013. Below-ground seed removal and subterranean trap data were collected mid-July through late-August 2013. Wet season pitfall trap data was collected mid-July through mid-August 2013. Dry season pitfall trap data was collected early-February through early-March 2014.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
1. Folder List:
a. data - holds the "raw_data" folder and "rdata" folder. The "raw_data" folder consists of the "csv" folder which holds all the csv raw data files used in the analyses. The "rdata" folder holds specific analyses such as NMDS or PCA results generated from R scripts. 
b. figs - holds the figures generated from R scripts that are presented in the either the manuscript main text or supplementary files.
c. Man - contains the readme files for each of the csv raw data files and for the one function created in an R script.
d. R - contains all the R scripts used in the analyses for the associated manuscript.
2. Relationship between files, if important: Raw csv files are called in R scripts to generate analyses. The ordination analyses R data are saved in the "rdata" folder. The figures generated by R scripts are in the "figs" folder. The documents explaining the different variables and columns in the raw csv files are in the "Man" folder.
3. Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package: Plant traits are found in Ruzi, S.A., D.P. Roche, P-C. Zalamea, A.C. Robison, and J.W. Dalling. 2017. Species identity influences secondary removal of seeds of Neotropical pioneer tree species. Plant Ecology. 218: 983-995. doi:10.1007/s11258-017-0745-7
4. Are there multiple versions of the dataset? no
a. If yes, names of file(s) that was updated: not applicable
i. Why the file was updated? not applicable
ii. When was the file updated? not applicable
