The freq data pitfalls dry wet season file is intended to document the dataset analyzed and to facilitate reanalysis. It contains frequency data of ant species captured at different sites by season collected using pitfall traps. Data was collected from five sites at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. 15-16 pitfall traps were placed within subplots in a site (see Figure S1a in associated manuscript), twice per season. Traps located at the same spot within a site and season were pooled, as the sampling locations were not independent. Therefore, the sample size of traps per site and per season is 16, for a total of 160 pitfall traps placed. This file is used to generate ant species accumulation curves, sampling coverage, and species estimates for ant communities sampled by pitfall traps by site and season.

Sample_num: total number of traps placed at this plot and season
Plot_abbre: An abbreviation of the plot (refered to as site in the associated manuscript). "25" = 25Ha or site 1, "A" = AVA or site 2, "D" = Dryaton or site 3, "P" = Pearson or site 4, "Z" = Zetek or site 5.
Season: the season in which the sample was taken.
Species: the Neotropical plant species associated with the sample. Can only be "P" = passive, as all are pitfall traps and not associated with specific plant species.}
Experiment: combination of the trap used and the season placed. Can either be "pitfall_dry" or "pitfall_wet" for this dataset.
