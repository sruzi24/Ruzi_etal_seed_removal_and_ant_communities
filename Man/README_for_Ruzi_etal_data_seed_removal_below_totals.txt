The data seed removal above totals file is intended to document the dataset analyzed and to facilitate reanalysis. It contains data on seed removal from Neotropical pioneer tree species placed approximatly two centimeters within the topsoil at five sites on Barro Colorado Island, Panama during the wet season of 2013. It is used in the partial least squares regression analyses. This data was also used in: Ruzi, S.A., D.P. Roche, P-C. Zalamea, A.C. Robison*, and J.W. Dalling. 2017. Species identity influences secondary removal of seeds of Neotropical pioneer tree species. Plant Ecology 218(8): 983-995. doi:10.1007/s11258-017-0745-7

1. Number of variables: 12
2. Number of cases/rows: 140
3. Variable List: 
Species: the Neotropical pioneer tree species. ApMe = Apeiba membranacea, CeLo = Cecropia longipes, JaCo = Jacaranda copaia, OcPy = Ochroma pyramidale, TrBl = Trema micrantha "black",  ZaEk = Zanthoxylum ekmanii, Glass = silica beads
Season: the season tested in
Dispersion: primary dispersal mode
Num.weeks: the number of weeks the seed cache was in the environment for
Plot: the prexisting site in the forest where caches were placed
Direction: the randomized side of the plot where the caches were placed
Replicate: the trial number of the caches placed at a plot
Total.Recovered: the total number of seeds recovered when the seed cache was dug back up
Total.Removed: the total number of seeds removed. Calculated as the number of seeds placed (10) minus the "Total.Recovered"
Partial.Recovered: the number of seeds that were not intact when recovered
Vials.Present: whether there were subterranean traps present
Dormancy: the type of seed dormancy that the seeds of Neotropical pioneer tree species have
