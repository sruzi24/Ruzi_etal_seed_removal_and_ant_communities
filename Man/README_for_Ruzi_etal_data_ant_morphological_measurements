The morphological measurements file is intended to document the ant morphological features analyzed and facilitate its reanalysis. This dataset is used to calculate PCA and ANOVAs on the loadings.

1. Number of variables: 27
2. Number of cases/rows: 22
3. Variable List: 
Species: ant species identification
Sp_ID: the shortened abbreviation for the ant species identification
Pitfalls_highest_cutoff_met: cutoffs for the percentage of traps collected in at a single site both seasons pooled
Above_seed_removal: whether foragers of this ant species were collected during timeperiods where ants were observed removing seed(s)
Experiment: the category that the ant species fall into (ie., common in pitfall traps, observed removing seeds, or both)
Specimen_ID: in this dataset all "pooled" as it is the aggregated measurments across all the individuals measured
Num_Individuals: the number of individuals measured for this species
HW_avg: average of head width measurement
HL_avg: average of head length measurement
OW_avg: average of intraocular width measurement
ML_avg: average of mandible length measurement
SL_avg: average of scape length measurement
EW_avg: average of eye width measurement
EL_avg: average of eye length measurement
HF_avg: average of hind femur length measurement
WL_avg: average of Weber's length measurement
EP_avg: average of eye position. Eye position is calculated as head width minus intraocular width.
HW_SD:standard deviation of head width measurement
HL_SD:standard deviation of head length measurement
OW_SD:standard deviation of intraocular width measurement
ML_SD:standard deviation of mandible length measurement
SL_SD:standard deviation of scape length measurement
EW_SD:standard deviation of eye width measurement
EL_SD:standard deviation of eye length measurement
HF_SD:standard deviation of hind femur length measurement
WL_SD:standard deviation of Weber's length measurement
EP_SD:standard deviation of eye position
