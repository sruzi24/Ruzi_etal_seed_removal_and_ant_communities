The seed removal data file is intended to document the dataset analyzed and to facilitate reanalysis. It contains data of foragers of different ant species observed in seed removal dishes, whether the ants were observed removing seeds, and whether there was a change in seed count. It is used to determine: (i) number and percent of time periods where there was an hourly change in seed count out of all daytime intervals with seeds remaining, (ii) number and percent of time periods where ants were present, (iii) number and percent of time periods where ants were observed removing seeds, (iv) the total number of time periods ants coult have been observed removing seeds per plant species, (v) the plant species with that have more than three ant samples collected, (vi) list of ant species that had foragers observed removing seeds, and (vii) to find which ant species had foragers collected in the most number of time periods.

NA = data not applicable
blank = data not available

1. Number of variables: 36
2. Number of cases/rows: 3750
3. Variable List:
Plot: the site in Barro Colorado Island, Panama where the data was collected.
Replicate: the trial number at that particular site ("Plot").
Species: the Neotropical pioneer plant species that the seed cache was for.
Day: the day the sampling point was from. Days 1 and 2 were from 10am to 4pm while Day 3 only had a 9am point.
Time.Point: the hour at which the data point was collected. Days 1 and 2 range from 10-16 (10am to 4pm) and Day 3 is only 9.
Observed.ant.present: whether an ant was observed in the seed cache. "0" = no ant was observed. "1" or "SAR###" indicates that there was at least one ant observed in the dish. The "SAR###" refers to a collection code from Selina A. Ruzi.
observed.ant.removing: whether an ant was observed removing at least one seed from the seed cache. "0" = ants were not observed removing seeds. "1" or "SAR###" indicates that there was at least one ant observed removing a seed from the dish. The "SAR###" refers to a collection code from Selina A. Ruzi.
sample.of.ant.observed.removing: whether a sample of the ant forager(s) removing seed(s) from the seed cache was collected. "0" = no ant sample was collected. "1" or "SAR###" indicates that there was a sample collected. The "SAR###" refers to a collection code from Selina A. Ruzi.
ant.sample: If an ant sample was collected then "SAR###" indicates the collection code from Selina A. Ruzi.
ant.identification: the ant species that were identified from the "ant.sample"
