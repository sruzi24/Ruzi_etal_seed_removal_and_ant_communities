The removal pitfalls met criteria file is intended to document the dataset analyzed and to facilitate reanalysis. It includes frequency data and seed removal data of the three most commonly removed tree species (ie. there were at least three timeperiods in which there were ant samples collected) and the ant communities captured by pitfall traps at those same sites. It is used to determine if ant communities observed removing seeds of the three most commonly observed tree species being removed by ants are distinct from the ant communities captured at the same sites by pitfall traps. 

1. Number of variables: 63
2. Number of cases/rows: 16
3. Variable List: 
ID: combination of "Plot_abbre" and "Season" and includes the tree species if sample came from observing the seed removal caches

Sample_num: sample size. Either the total number of traps placed for pitfall traps or the total number of time periods where there could have been an ant observed removing seeds (different for different tree species as it is based on the number of daytime time periods where there was an hourly change in seed count and there were seeds remaining to be removed).
Plot_abbre: An abbreviation of the plot (refered to as site in the associated manuscript). "25" = 25Ha or site 1, "A" = AVA or site 2, "D" = Dryaton or site 3, "P" = Pearson or site 4, "Z" = Zetek or site 5.
Season: the season in which the sample was taken
Species: the Neotropical plant species associated with the sample. "P" = passive to indicate they are pitfall traps which are not associated with specific plant species.
Experiment: the experiment in which the ants were captured. If pitfall then it includes the season. If "removal" then indicates that the sample was observed removing seeds from the seed cache.
Plot_season: combination of the "Plot_abbre" and "Season"
