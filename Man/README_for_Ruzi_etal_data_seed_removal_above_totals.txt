The data seed removal above totals file is intended to document the dataset analyzed and to facilitate reanalysis. It contains data on seed removal from Neotropical pioneer tree species placed in petri dish caches at five sites on Barro Colorado Island, Panama during the dry and wet seasons of 2013. It is used in the partial least squares regression analyses. This data was also used in: Ruzi, S.A., D.P. Roche, P-C. Zalamea, A.C. Robison*, and J.W. Dalling. 2017. Species identity influences secondary removal of seeds of Neotropical pioneer tree species. Plant Ecology 218(8): 983-995. doi:10.1007/s11258-017-0745-7
