The below frequency condensed file is intended to document the dataset analyzed and to facilitate reanalysis. It contains frequency data of ant species captured in different samples collected from subterranean traps placed at different sites at Barro Colorado Island, Panama and associated either with seed caches from Neotropical pioneer tree species or control caches or passive traps. Only ant species that were captured are included in this file. It is used to determine which ant species are captured in different trap types.

Sample_num: total number of traps placed at this plot and cache type during the wet season. It is always 4 for this dataset.
Plot_abbre: An abbreviation of the plot (refered to as site in the associated manuscript). "25" = 25Ha or site 1, "A" = AVA or site 2, "D" = Dryaton or site 3, "P" = Pearson or site 4, "Z" = Zetek or site 5.
Season: the season in which the sample was taken. For this dataset it can only be during the wet season.
Species: the Neotropical plant species associated with the sample.
Experiment: the community that was sampled. For this dataset, all are "below".
